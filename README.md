To create, remote into and upload the current local repo to GitHub use `gh repo create --public --push -r=main -s ./`. **Note, this will name the repo after the current folder name.**
You have to have GitHub CLI installed and logged into GitHub with the CLI. [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) also has a [User Manual for creating repos with the CLI](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_repo_create)
To login with the CLI type `gh auth login` to login.

CLONE: `gh repo clone home-page ./ -u main`
